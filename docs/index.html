<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This course is the first of a two-quarter introductory quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the social sciences.
Students are introduced to the full stack of skills needed to conduct modern social science data analysis including data visualization, data wrangling, programming for data analysis, reproducible research, probability and statistical inference, linear regression, and causal inference.
Students will learn these skills while applying them to their own research problem.
The objective of this course is to provide students with a hands-on introduction and overview of modern social science data analysis and a base of skills to pursue further research in quantitative methods.
The next course in the sequence, POLS 503, covers linear models and causal inference methods in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h3>

<p>By the end of the course students will be able to</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete a research project demonstrating mastery of statistical data analysis from exploratory analysis to inference to modeling</li>
<li>Visualize data and statistical models using R</li>
<li>Import and clean tabular data for use in statistical analysis using R</li>
<li>Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code using current best practices</li>
<li>Produce reproducible research using literate programming (R Markdown), version control (git and GitHub), and current best practices</li>
<li>Explain the difference between descriptive, predictive, and causal statistical questions.</li>
<li>Explain the difference between estimation and hypothesis testing that can be used to make causal claims from observational data</li>
<li>Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from  t-tests, <code>$\chi^2$</code> tests, and linear regression.</li>
<li>Explain limitations of causal inference using observational data (selection on observables) and methods for making causal inference with observational data (difference-in-difference, before-and-after, regression discontinuity).</li>
<li>Feel empowered working with data</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The course is suitable for students with a large range of prior exposure to statistics and mathematics. No prior statistical, mathematical, or programming experience is necessary beyond arithmetic, algebra, and elementary calculus.<br />
The most important prerequisite is a willingness to work hard on possibly unfamiliar material.</p>

<p>Since the background of students taking this course is heterogeneous, the topics and structure of the course is such that those with a wide background of technical skills are likely to find something useful in it.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<p>There are three main types of assignments for students</p>

<ol>
<li>Weekly homework: Learning data analysis requires practice. There will be weekly homework assignments. See the <a href="./assignments/">assignments</a> page.</li>
<li>Research project: Students will complete a research project. The expectation is that students will work on the project throughout the quarter and apply concepts and skills to that project soon after covering them in class. See the <a href="./projects/">project</a> page for more details.</li>
<li>Reading Assignments: Students are expected to come to class prepared. I have chosen textbooks that are accessible, so we will not spend valuable class time summarizing assigned readings. Instead we will use class for more value-added learning activities. As part of that, before each class students will provide feedback and questions on the readings that will be used to guide class in-class discussion.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<h3 id="computational-tools">Computational Tools</h3>

<p>Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.</p>

<p>This course will use <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, which is an easy-to-use interface to R.
Instructions to install or upgrade R are <a href="./pages/install/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This course will also use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (through RStudio)
for version control, which is like &ldquo;track changes&rdquo; for a directory of files, in reproducible research.
Homework assignments will be distributed and submitted via <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, which is a website that hosts git repositories.
If that did not make sense, don&rsquo;t worry; we&rsquo;ll cover it in the course.</p>

<p>Students will have access to <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education">DataCamp classroom</a>. You can use this for additional practice.</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>This course will primarily rely on the following texts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imai, Kosuke. 2017. <em>Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction.</em> Princeton University Press.</li>
<li>Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media. (free online)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Quantitative Social Science</em> (<em>QSS</em>) will provide the outline of the statistical topics that we will cover.
<em>R for Data Science</em> (<em>R4DS</em>) covers R programming for data visualization and wrangling.</p>

<p>Additionally, these texts are supplemented by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jrnold.github.io/qss-tidy/">QSS Tidyverse Code</a>. <em>R4DS</em> and this course will use a set of R packages known as the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. However, <em>QSS</em> does not. This course supplements <em>QSS</em> with <em>tidyverse</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/">R for Data Science Solutions</a>, to help you when working through <em>R for Data Science</em> problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be some additional readings as indicated in the <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Students will be evaluated on the whole of their work in this course.</p>

<p>For this course, grades on the 4.0 scale have the following interpretation:</p>

<table class = "table table-striped">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>4.0</td>
      <td>Exceptional</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.9</td>
      <td>Very good</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.8</td>
      <td>Meeting expectations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.7</td>
      <td>Somewhat below average</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.6</td>
      <td>Not up to expectations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&le; 3.5</td>
      <td>Way below expectations</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
