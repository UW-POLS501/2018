      <description>A good place to start is Rstudio’s guide for getting help with R
Asking for Help When asking for help with R it is important to at least
Include the exact code that you ran The error message that you got  Without the code and the error message it can be hard to impossible to diagnose the problem and provide a solution. Questions such as “This isn’t working” or even “I’m getting this error message” aren’t useful without the code and error message.</description>

      <description>For the project assignments, each student has a repository named UW-POLS501/:username where :username is the GitHub username of the student. This does not need to be forked. The student works directly on that repository, and submits assignments by opening an issue on UW-POLS501/:username/issue.

      <description>One of the most important principles in writing software is “don’t repeat yourself (DRY)”. This module covers using functions, for-loops, and functionals to avoid copying and pasting code.
In addition to this, see the the R for Data Science chapters Functions a Iteration (for-loops and functions) for more detailed discussions of these concepts.
Setup Consider the example from QSS Exercise 1. Review the explanations and instructions for that question.

      <description>Visualization Other resources:
 All the graph things Stat 545. Jenny Bryan.   Tibbles Why might you want to create non-syntactic variable names? Since variable names are often used as in plots (e.g. axis-titles) or headers in tables, where having spaces or other characters that are invalid R variable names is useful. Those functions will have ways to use text other than the column, but using the non-syntactic variable name can be convenient.</description>
