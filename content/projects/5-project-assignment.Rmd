Address theoretical, data, and methodological issues from the previous data analysis assignments.

At this stage, your data wrangling should be complete, and that section should be mostly written.

In this draft you should make some attempt at analysis that answers your research question.
Consider the following.

1. Is it a causal question? What is the identification strategy? What assumptions are being made, and are they plausible? 
2. Is it a predictive question? How are your measuring predictive performance? Are the out-of-sample tests appropriate?
3. Is it a descriptive question? Why are your measures appropriate?

If due to data issues, you cannot run an analysis, clearly describe your plan. 
Do your best to run some analysis. We will use next week to work on your projects. 
Having something written, no matter how "imperfect", provides a basis for discussion and improvement.
